# Auckland Solar Potential Analysis
New Zealand is a country that primarily uses renewable sources most of its electricity and aims to be 100% renewable by 2030 (MBIE, 2023). Fitting solar panels to roofs on a large scale could potentially greatly support this goal. This report determines roofs areas that are valid for solar panel placement and further identifies the top 30% of buildings based on solar potential in the target areas3.

## Introduction
The target areas identified for this project are the Auckland Airport Industrial zone, Manukau, East Tāmaki, and Ōtāhuhu. Figure 1 shows the chosen priority areas along with the polygon feature class containing the footprints of the buildings taken from Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) aerial imagery in and around the areas.
